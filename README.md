# Kitaev-Simulation
Kitaev chain simulation in k-space by circuit QED, finished during the last year of my undergraduate and first year of PhD

## unzip data
unzip the data/data.zip into the directory: Kitaev-Simulation/data/

Fig2,3,4
First two columns are x,y axis
last two columns are sigma_y,sigma_z represent an arrow

Fig7
x = np.linspace(0,2,41) # k/pi
y = np.linspace(-4,4,41) # lambda_2
